# Virtual desktops

A virtual desktop is a virtualized computing environment with a graphical user interface (GUI) easily accessible through a web browser. A group of students can use preconfigured virtual desktops (virtual classroom) in a similar way as a physical classroom but with more flexibility as it can be accessed from home and at any time. High-performance server infrastructure hosting virtual classrooms can provide better computing capabilities for highly demanding simulation software.
