# Jupyter Hub

RTU HPC Jupyter Hub: [https://jhub.hpc.rtu.lv/](https://jhub.hpc.rtu.lv/)

Access to the Jupyther Hub can be requested through the RTU HPC center: [Registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsEhMkfAGtDyS6z6yYo0mDf1PQRxC06fxPI2D7YVzvDrwa-g/viewform?c=0&w=1).

JupyterHub is an open-source graphical programming environment accessible through a web interface. Currently, programming in Python and R languages is supported on the RTU Jupyter environment. The prepared tasks can be run on a single 32 vCPU and 64GB RAM virtual machine, but in the future, it is planned to create the possibility of running tasks on GPUs and the whole cluster.
