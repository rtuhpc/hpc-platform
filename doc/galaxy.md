# Galaxy portal
Galaxy is an open platform for supporting data intensive research with focus on biomedical data (for example, genome, transcriptome, proteome) analyses. The analyses can be performed using graphical tools and hence could be easily performed also by non-bioinformaticians.  

RTU HPC Galaxy instance is available here: https://galaxy.hpc.rtu.lv. Access to this galaxy can be requested by sending an email to hpc@rtu.lv. You should be able to auto-register also with your RTU HPC cluster credentials. Any requests regarding tools or reference datasets can be sent to support e-mail as well. 

In the next Figure example quality control report in Galaxy using FastQC is shown.
