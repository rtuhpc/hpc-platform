# Galaxy portal
Galaxy is an open platform for supporting data-intensive research focusing on biomedical, chemical, and general data analyses, including statistics, machine learning, and visualization tools. The analyses can be performed using a graphical environment and hence could be easily used by non-bioinformaticians. The RTU Galaxy instance is connected to the HPC cluster and serves as a web-based GUI to submit analyses to the cluster.

The Galaxy interface is shown in the following figure. It is an example output of the sequencing quality control tool FastQC.
